            <h1>Our pragmatic-first approach to a new framework</h1>
            <p>SetJS has been our main recipe for building SPAs and JS heavy web projects for more than 6 years. Before we created SetJS, we used React.js in a few small and medium size projects. However, we realised the heavy abstractions, which might work for really large scale projects, were more of a burden than a boon for our small team.</p>
            <p>SetJS did not reach its current form immediately though, it took us years to perfect it to our needs. We decided on major principles, then refined our code to better achieve those principles over time.</p>
